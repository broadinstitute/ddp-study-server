automatic_scaling:
  max_instances: 4 #up to 2147483647
  min_instances: 0 #0 means first one starts only on first request. Needs additional setup to use
  max_idle_instances: 1 #default is automatic
  min_idle_instances: 0 #also needs additional setup
  target_cpu_utilization: 0.8 #0.6 is the default. Higher might trigger new instances created
  target_throughput_utilization: 0.8 #default is 0.6 . Also metric to launch more instances
  max_concurrent_requests: 10 #default is 10 . Max is 80. GCP recommends 10 max value.
  max_pending_latency: 60ms #Default is 30ms. Max time a request is allowed to wait in queue.
  min_pending_latency: 60ms #Default is 30ms. Threshold used to scale down
network:
  instance_tag: study-server # necessary for firewall rules so that DSM will accept https requests from pepper
