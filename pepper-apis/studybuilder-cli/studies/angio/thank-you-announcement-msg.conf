                        Thanks again for helping us and the entire angiosarcoma community! The success of this project is completely
                        dependent on engaged patients who are willing to participate and spread the word. Please help us reach other
                        patients with angiosarcoma to let them know about the project -- with your help, we can launch a movement
                        that will allow all patients with angiosarcoma to drive the discoveries we so desperately need.
