              led to the development of drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of
              tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still

              that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work.  Using gene sequencing as a way to read DNA is one
              way to identify alterations that may contribute to the behavior of cancer. Some alterations or changes
