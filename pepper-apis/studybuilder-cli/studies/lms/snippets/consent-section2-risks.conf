You may have heard of some of the genes we find in tumor samples and some people may think they are connected to aspects of the disease, like severity or treatments, even though the evidence is currently unclear. Our goal is to generate data for research to better understand these areas of uncertainty and contribute to changes in knowledge about genes like this.</li>

At this time, you cannot be identified through this research, if the samples and specimens are de-identified. There is a risk that you might be reidentified in the future as genetic research progresses.
              <br>
              Your de-identified specimens or genetic data will be placed into one or more publicly-accessible scientific databases.  Through such databases, researchers from around the world will have access to de-identified samples or data for future research.
              <br>
              There is a risk that deidentified research data that is shared with outside collaborators may be reidentified. When deidentified data and specimens are shared with outside collaborators agreements limit what the outside collaborators can do with the information to help prevent reidentification.
