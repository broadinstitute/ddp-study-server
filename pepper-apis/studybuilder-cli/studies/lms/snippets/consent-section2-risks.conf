You may have heard of some of the genes we find in tumor samples and some people may think they are connected to aspects of the disease, like severity or treatments, even though the evidence is currently unclear. Our goal is to generate data for research to better understand these areas of uncertainty and contribute to changes in knowledge about genes like this.</li>

              <br>
              Your de-identified specimens or genetic data will be placed into one or more publicly-accessible scientific databases.  Through such databases, researchers from around the world will have access to de-identified samples or data for future research.
