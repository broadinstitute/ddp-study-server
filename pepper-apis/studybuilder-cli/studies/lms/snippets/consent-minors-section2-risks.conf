              (which may include information from survey responses, your child’s medical records, and/or sample testing
              and analysis) could be seen by people who do not have permission. However, we have procedures and security

              information is stored. There is a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
              (GINA), which protects your child from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health
              insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against your child based on
              their genetic information. However, this law does not protect your child against genetic discrimination by
              companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If your child
              already has or has had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an

              Future research studies may include genetic research. Your child’s genes are unique to them. At this time,
              your child cannot be identified through this research, if the samples and specimens are de-identified. There is a
              risk that your child might be reidentified in the future as genetic research progresses.
              <br>
              <br>
              Your child’s de-identified specimens or genetic data will be placed into one or more publicly-accessible
              scientific databases.  Through such databases, researchers from around the world will have access to
              de-identified samples or data for future research.

              There is a risk that deidentified research data that is shared with outside collaborators may be
              reidentified. When deidentified data and specimens are shared with outside collaborators agreements limit
              what the outside collaborators can do with the information to help prevent reidentification.
