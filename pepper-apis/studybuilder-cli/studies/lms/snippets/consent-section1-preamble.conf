              "Count Me In" is a patient-driven movement that enables cancer patients
              to directly transform cancer research and discovery. Any individual who has ever been diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma,
              has the opportunity to share information about their experience through completing surveys, sharing biological samples
              (saliva, blood and/or tumor samples), and copies of their medical records with researchers in order to accelerate the
              pace of discovery. Because we are open to participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated,
              this study will allow many more patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible."""
