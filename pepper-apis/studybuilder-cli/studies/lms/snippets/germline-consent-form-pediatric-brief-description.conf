People who have been diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma across the US and Canada have the opportunity to share information about their experience through completing surveys, sharing biological samples (saliva, blood, and/or tumor samples), and copies of their medical records with researchers. Because we are open to participants across the country regardless of where they are treated, this study will allow many more cancer patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible."""
