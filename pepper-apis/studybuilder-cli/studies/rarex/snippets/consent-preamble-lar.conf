              This form is for use in a research study that may involve participants who do not have the

              gives consent, the participant should be informed about the study to the extent possible given
              his/her understanding. Where possible, the participant will also be asked to provide agreement

              regains the capacity to consent, informed consent will be obtained from the participant and the
              participant offered the ability to leave the study if desired.
