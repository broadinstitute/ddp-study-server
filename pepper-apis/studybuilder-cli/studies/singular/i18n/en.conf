      "p2": "We are asking you to take part in a research study. We are asking for one of two reasons: <br/>(1) You have a single ventricle heart defect; or <br/>(2) You are a close family member (birth child, sibling, or parent) of someone with a single ventricle heart defect.",
      "p3": "Taking part in the study is all your choice. You can choose if you want to take part or not, and you can quit the study at any time.",
      "p4": "The goal of this study is to learn more about people with single ventricle heart disease. To do this, we need to collect genetic and health information from them. We also need to collect this information from their close family, including birth parents, siblings, and children.",
      "p5": "We will ask you to answer questions about your health. If you have a single ventricle heart defect, we will ask you to sign a medical record release form. We will also ask you to send us a sample of your saliva (spit), which we will use for genetic testing (studying your genes).",
      "p5_2": "Your privacy is very important to us. We will store your information securely. Researchers can use the information to study single ventricle heart defects. They can also use it to study many other diseases.",
      "p6": "Researchers around the world can use the information, but the information will be “de-identified.” This means we will take out details such as your name and birth date. This makes it hard to identify you from the information. We will protect your privacy the best we can, but there is a small risk someone may see information that identifies you.",

This information will help us learn what may cause the defects and possibly other related health problems.",
        "p2": "Those who take part in Project Singular will need to send us a few things. We will need a saliva (spit) sample. If you have a single ventricle heart defect, we will ask for information from your medical records. We will ask you to fill out a survey that will ask health questions. We will securely store all this information, and saliva samples will be kept in a secure gene bank. The samples will be processed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which is a nonprofit biomedical research institute.",
        "p3": "We will share this information with researchers around the world, but the information will be “de-identified.” This means we will take out details like name and birth date, which makes it hard to link information back to a person."

        "p2": "You will need to send us a sample of your spit. We will mail you a kit to use to collect the sample and send back to us, free of charge.",
        "p3": "If you have a single ventricle heart defect, we will ask you to send us contact information for your doctor and sign a medical release form. This will allow your doctor to send us your medical records and will give us the ability to collect and store your medical records now and in the future. That way, we can update your health information, which will be useful for researchers doing studies.",

        "p2": "Genes are parts of your DNA. Genes have instructions for how cells in your body should work and grow. We will study your DNA through “gene sequencing”, a way to read DNA. Gene sequencing lets us look for information in genes that may change the way your cells work. These changes may lead to different diseases. The goal of genetic research is to learn more about these diseases. We also want to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases.",
        "p3": "Sometimes researchers will only study a small part of DNA the part they know can cause a disease. We don’t know much about single ventricle heart disease, so we will look at all or most of your genes. This is called whole genome sequencing.

        "p1": "We may share your information with other researchers, but the information will be “de-identified.” This means the researchers won’t be able to identify you. This also means they can’t ask you if they can use your information in future studies, so you won’t get to choose if your information is used in these studies. These future research studies may be on diseases other than single ventricle heart disease. Some researchers may study ways to measure health or how health might change with certain treatments or care. Some of these studies may be with for-profit companies for commercial uses so the companies can try to develop new treatments."

        "p2": "Right now, we don’t know which parts of DNA cause single ventricle heart defects. That is why we’re doing this study. This means we don’t know which parts of your (or your family member’s) DNA may cause single ventricle heart disease, so we cannot give you any information about your (or your family member’s) genetic cause. In the future, we may make those discoveries and if we do, we may contact you. We may ask if you want information about your genetics specific to single ventricle heart disease, but we don’t know if or when this might be possible.",
        "p3": "Project Singular may provide a summary of research results. We may email you the summary or put it on our website. Single ventricle heart disease likely comes from many causes, which means not all results will apply to all patients - not even major discoveries. We may publish results, but the results may not be specific to your (or your family member’s) single ventricle heart defect.",

When we do, we may find changes in your DNA that may be linked to some other disease that is not single ventricle heart disease. These results are called “secondary findings.” This type of result is not common, and most people in this study will not have a result like this.",
        "p2": "You have a choice as to whether or not you would want to know about a result like this. At the end of this consent form, we will ask if you would want to know about this kind of result if we find one.

        "p2": "You may learn that you have a genetic risk for a disease other than single ventricle heart disease. Although it’s not likely, it is possible, and this could be upsetting to you. Your genetic information is unique to you, but you do share some genes with your parents, siblings, children, and other blood relatives. This means your genetic results could tell you something about your family, which might upset you or your family.

Your child’s genetic information is unique to him or her. But your child does share some genes with you. Your child also shares some genes with his or her parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood relatives. This means your child’s genetic results could also tell you something about yourself or your family, which might upset you or your family.
