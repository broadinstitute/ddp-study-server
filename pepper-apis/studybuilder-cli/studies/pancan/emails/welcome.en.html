  "goal": "The goal of this initiative is to generate a large dataset that includes a variety of patient-reported, genomic, clinical, and molecular information that can be shared with the biomedical community in order to accelerate discoveries and better therapies for all types of cancers. Cancer is not a single disease, and each patient story, survey response, medical record, and tumor sample holds part of the puzzle. Our goal is to help the research community better understand the landscape of cancer as a whole and accelerate discoveries by making data more readily available.",
