              Participation requires little effort. With you permission, we may ask that you send a sample of your child's saliva to
              us in a pre-stamped package that we will provide. We may also ask for your child's medical records. If so,
              we will take care of obtaining copies of your child's medical records from the hospitals or centers where your child
              receives their medical care. If needed, we may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign an
              additional release form for your child's medical records to be shared with us. If you elect to share your child's tissue with
              us, we may also obtain small amounts of your child's stored tumor tissues from hospitals or centers where
              your child receives their care. If you elect to share your child's blood with us, we may ask to have a sample of blood
              (1 tube or 2 teaspoons) drawn at your child's physician's office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility â€“ we will
              provide detailed instructions on how to do this."""
