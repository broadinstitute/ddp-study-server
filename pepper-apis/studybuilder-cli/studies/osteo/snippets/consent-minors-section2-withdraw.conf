              Your child can stop being in the research study at any time. We will not be able to withdraw all the information

              return any remaining tumor samples from where we obtained them, and destroy any remaining blood,
              saliva samples, or DNA samples we have. We will not perform any additional tests on the samples.
              Additionally, we will not collect any additional medical records and we will destroy the medical records
              we already have. However, we will keep the results from the tests we did before your child stopped being
              in the study. We will also keep the information we learned from reviewing your child's medical records before
              your child stopped being in the study, We will not be able to take back the information that already has been
              used or shared with other researchers, central data banks, or that has been used to carry out related
