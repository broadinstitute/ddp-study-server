              In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure, there is a Federal law, known as the Genetic

              generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to
              discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you

              care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results
