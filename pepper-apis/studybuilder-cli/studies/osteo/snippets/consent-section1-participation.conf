              Participation requires little effort. With your permission, we may ask that you send a saliva sample to
              us in a pre-stamped package that we will provide. We may also ask for your medical records. If so,
              we will take care of obtaining copies of your medical records from the hospitals or centers where you
              receive your medical care. If needed, we may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign an
              additional release form for your medical records to be shared with us. If you elect to share tissue with
              us, we may also obtain small amounts of your stored tumor tissues from hospitals or centers where
              you receive your care. If you elect to share blood with us, we may ask you to have a sample of blood
              (1 tube or 2 teaspoons) drawn at your physician's office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility â€“ we will
              provide detailed instructions on how to do this."""
