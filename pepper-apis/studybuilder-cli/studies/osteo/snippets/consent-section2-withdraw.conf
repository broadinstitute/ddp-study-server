              You can stop being in the research study at any time. We will not be able to withdraw all the information
              that already has been used for research. If you tell us that you want to stop being in the study, we will
              return any remaining tumor samples from where we obtained them, and destroy any remaining blood,
              saliva samples, or DNA samples we have. We will not perform any additional tests on the samples.
              Additionally, we will not collect any additional medical records and we will destroy the medical records
              we already have. However, we will keep the results from the tests we did before you stopped being
              in the study. We will also keep the information we learned from reviewing your medical records before
              you stopped being in the study. We will not be able to take back the information that already has been
              used or shared with other researchers, central data banks, or that has been used to carry out related
              activities such as oversight, or that is needed to ensure quality of the study."""
