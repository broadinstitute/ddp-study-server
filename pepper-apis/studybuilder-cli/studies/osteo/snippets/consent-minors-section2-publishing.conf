              The gene tests in this study are being done to add to our knowledge of how genes and other factors
              affect cancer. This information will be kept confidential and while you will not receive information about
              your child's personal results obtained from studying your child's blood, saliva, or tissue samples, we will provide
              general results and major discoveries to all participants. We will do this by regularly updating the
              website that you used to enroll in this study. Furthermore, we will publish important discoveries found
              through these studies in the scientific literature so that the entire research community can work
              together to better understand cancer. Your child's individual data will not be published in a way in which your child
              could be readily identified. Abstracts, which are plain language summaries of the published reports,
              will be available to you and the general public."""
