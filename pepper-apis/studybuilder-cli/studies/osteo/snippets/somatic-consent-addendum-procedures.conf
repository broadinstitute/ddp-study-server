The information we may be able to share would include a letter and a report about the genetic alterations found in your tumor. If you elect to participate, we will contact you through the email associated with your participation when the shared learnings are ready and we will ask that you confirm that you’d like this information before it is shared. If you do not want to receive these shared learnings at any time, please inform a study team member by emailing <a href="mailto:info@osproject.org" class="Link">info@osproject.org</a>."""
