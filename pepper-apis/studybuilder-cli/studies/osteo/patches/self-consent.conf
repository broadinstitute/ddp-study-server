              Cancers occur when the molecules that control cell growth (such as genes or proteins) become changed or altered. Changes in genes are called “alterations” and can occur in cancer cells or normal tissues. Some alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified, which has led to the development of drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. A key goal of this research study is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described.

We may perform different tests or analyses to determine if cells in the samples provided through this study contain any alterations.

Genes are composed of DNA “letters,” which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work.  Using gene sequencing as a way to read DNA is one way to identify alterations that may contribute to the behavior of cancer. Some alterations or changes occur only in cancer cells. Other alterations may occur in normal cells as well, including in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child.
