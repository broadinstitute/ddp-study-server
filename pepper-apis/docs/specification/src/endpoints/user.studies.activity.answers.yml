  summary: create or update answers to activity instance
  description: |
    Accepts a list of answer submissions or updates and runs server-side
    validations on them before saving. The request is processed as a single
    transaction, so if a single answer submission fails then the whole request
    will fail.

    **Answer Submissions**

    When processing list of answer submissions, a submission with an
    `answerGuid` will be treated as an update and the referenced answer will
    be updated accordingly. If `answerGuid` is missing, the server attempts to
    find and update an existing answer only if the question has a single
    answer. Otherwise, it responses with `500 Internal Server Error`. The
    response body will contain more details about what failed.

    **Answer Validations**

    Server-side form validation will only run for the given answers. Use the
    `PUT` request to run validation on full form. When validation fails, API
    responses with `422 Unprocessable Entity` to indicate such. The response
    body will contain more details about which validation rule was violated.

    **Conditional Forms**

    The response will contain the visibility state of form blocks that may
    have been changed. If there are no blocks with "show-if" logic, then it
    simply contains an empty object/map. Otherwise, it provides the
    `blockGuid` and the new visibility state of blocks that are toggle-able.

    **Study Admins**

    Updating of answers is not supported if activity instance is hidden or
    read-only, or if question is read-only, unless operator is a study admin.

    _This API allows access to temporary users._

  summary: complete an activity instance
  description: |
    Indicates to server that user is done with an activity. This API ensures
    any required questions in an activity is answered, and then transitions
    the user's activity instance to an appropriate status (i.e. `COMPLETE`).
    If activity is a parent instance with nested child instances, then those
    child instances must have their required questions answered before the
    parent instance is allowed to be completed.

    Completing an activity may also trigger some server-side post-submission
    processes, if any are configured for the activity/study. Activities are
    typically part of a workflow along with other activities, thus this API
    returns the "next" state of the workflow as a suggestion of where to bring
    the user next. See the [Workflow API](#tag/Workflow) for more details.

    **Study Admins**

    Submitting activity is not supported if activity instance is hidden or
    read-only, unless operator is a study admin.
