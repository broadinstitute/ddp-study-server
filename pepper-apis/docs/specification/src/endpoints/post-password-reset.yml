  summary: Post Password Reset
  description: |
    This API may be used in the Auth0 Password Reset Flow. Clients should not
    call this directly, but rather configure their flow such that Auth0 calls
    this API after user finishes password reset. This API will then call the
    configured client application URL using a 302 redirect.

    The redirect will provide the following query parameters:
    - `email` (string): url-encoded email, if provided by auth0
    - `errorCode` (string): will be set to `PASSWORD_RESET_LINK_EXPIRED` if
      password reset flow failed
