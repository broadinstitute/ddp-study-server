  summary: fetch a complete activity instance
  description: |
    returns the complete version of the specified `activity` instance. This includes any answers the user may have previously saved.

    ### Working with COMPONENT types
    Some activities include objects identified as `COMPONENTS`. These are used to request that the client collect a potentially complex set of information from a user, and save it to the server. At the moment, the uses for this are to get the participant's mailing address or medical provider details.

    #### Mailing Address
    This components works in conjunction with the [Mailing Address](#tag/Mailing-Address) operations. In order to save the response from this question, a client should interact with the [getMailingAddress](#operation/getMailingAddress), [updateMailingAddress](#operation/updateMailingAddress), and [createMailingAddress](#operation/createMailingAddress) operations. Before allowing a participant to continue past this step, the client *should* call [verifyMailingAddress](#operation/verifyMailingAddress) in order to confirm that the address entered by the participant can be used as a valid delivery address, and to possibly perform corrections against the entered value.

    _This API allows access to temporary users._
