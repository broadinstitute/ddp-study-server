    Request for a new URL for file upload. Link is accessible for limited
    period of time (e.g. 5 mins). Resumable uploads are supported. With
    information in response body, client will be able to upload the file
    directly to a Google Bucket. If resumable=true is specified in request,
    client will assume responsibility for creating the session URI with
    provided URL in addition to follow up requests that contain the file
    contents (see [documentation][doc]).

    Activity file upload is not supported if activity instance/question is
    read-only or otherwise inaccessible, unless operator is a study admin.
