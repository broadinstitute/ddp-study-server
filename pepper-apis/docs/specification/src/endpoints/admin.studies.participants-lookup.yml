  summary: ParticipantsLookup
  description: |
    Given query with a single search term, lookup participants that matches
    this search term. The term will be used to match against information such
    as participant's identifiers, name, email, invitations, and proxy (if
    any). If the query is empty, then no results will be returned.

    Currently, this endpoint limits the max number of results it will return.
    If not all matches are returned, then the `totalCount` will indicate how
    many matches was actually found. In this case, clients should recommend
    that the user refine their search to be more specify.

    Note: requires study admin ID token.
