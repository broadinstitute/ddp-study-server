# This is the initial config for a http-to-https LB. To allow for simple
# substituting of name, we have a placeholder here. Simply `cat` this through
# `sed` to replace it. And load this config using the `--source` flag when
# creating the LB.

kind: compute#urlMap
name: {{name}}
defaultUrlRedirect:
  redirectResponseCode: MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT
  httpsRedirect: true
  stripQuery: false

# Tests help make sure the config behaves correctly. They are not part of the
# actual LB. Run these tests using `gcloud compute url-maps validate`.
#
# This is commented out for now because the gcloud console doesn't yet support
# editing these, so if we add these we'll be unable to edit the LB through the
# UI. You can uncomment and validate locally to ensure configs work.
