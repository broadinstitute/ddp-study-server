The purpose of this research is to help scientists understand how arrhythmias that predispose to sudden cardiac death, such as Brugada syndrome (SCD), are affected by genes and other factors. We hope this can help develop ways to better prevent SCD as well as diagnose and treat these genetic arrhythmias.",

      "p3": "Your sample will be stored until researchers need them to do research. Your saliva sample contains genetic information called DNA. Genes are parts of the DNA code that contain instructions for how cells in our bodies work and grow. We will study your DNA through a technology called “sequencing”.
