      <span class="bold">"The Global A-T Family Data Platform" initiative</span> is a participant-driven effort,
      overseen by ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) research advocates, that will empower people with A-T and their
      families to help transform research and treatment of the disease by sharing their genetic data and related
      health information with researchers around the world. If families also agree to allow researchers to contact
      them with follow-up research questions, the platform will enable the A-T community to have a continuous
      dialogue with researchers and potentially accelerate progress in A-T research. The ultimate goal of this effort
      is to create an environment in which the A-T community and their families contribute their clinical and genetic
      data and govern the sharing of these data with researchers to better understand the disease.

      We (the sponsors) want to better understand genetic and other biological and lifestyle-related factors
