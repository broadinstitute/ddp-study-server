  "consent_name": "Research Consent Form",
  "consent_title": "Research Consent Form",
  "consent_header": "Research Consent Form",
  "consent_intro_title": "Introduction",
  "consent_intro_1": "We are inviting you to take part in a research study. A person who participates in a research study is called a “participant”. This term will be used throughout this consent form. ",
  "consent_intro_2": "This research consent form explains why this research study is being done, what is involved in participating in the research study, the possible risks and benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and your rights as a research participant. The decision to participate is yours. If you decide to participate, please check yes or no on the consent questions, sign, and date at the end of the form. We will email you a copy so that you can refer to the consent form at any time.",
  "consent_intro_3": "We encourage you to take some time to think this over and to discuss it with other people and to ask questions now and at any time in the future.",
  "consent_intro_4": "This study is a patient-driven movement that involves participants sharing copies of their medical records and genetic test results with researchers in order to accelerate the pace of discovery. Because we are enrolling participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated, this study will allow many more patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible. It is expected that about 10,000 participants will take part in this research study over the next four years.",
  "consent_intro_5": "We hope that by studying the genetics and medical records of many participants, we will gain a better understanding of cancer. Some of the questions we aim to answer are:",
  "consent_predict_develop": "Can we predict which patients will develop metastatic disease?",
  "consent_predict_respond": "Can we predict which patients will respond to a particular treatment?",
  "consent_particular_genetics": "Do patients with particular genetics live longer than others?",
  "consent_research_purpose_title": "Why is this research study being done?",
  "consent_research_purpose_1": "The purpose of this research project is to partner with patients to collect and study genetic and health information to improve our understanding of cancer. Currently, there is a lot of information about the genetics and cancer care located in many different places. In this study we hope to bring as much of this information together as possible. Researchers can then use the stored information in future studies. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect cancer, or how genes affect response to treatment. (Genes, which are made up of DNA, have the information needed to build and operate a human body).",
  "consent_research_purpose_2": "The information collected in this study will be stored in a controlled-access database. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genetic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you.",
  "consent_other_options_title": "What other options are there?",
  "consent_other_options_body": "Taking part in this research study is voluntary. Instead of being in this research study, you may continue to obtain your clinical care without participating in the study. Your decision not to participate will not affect your clinical care in any way.",
  "consent_what_is_involved_in_study_title": "What is involved in the Research Study?",
  "consent_what_is_involved_in_study_1": "If you agree to participate, you will first fill out a short online questionnaire about your medical history. Then we will email you instructions about how to first request your genetic data from the lab where it was generated and then to send it to our study team.",
  "consent_what_is_involved_in_study_2": "On your behalf, we will also request your cancer-related medical records from your treatment provider. We may use a commercial third party, such as PicnicHealth, to obtain these. We will collect your medical records on an ongoing basis unless you withdraw from this study. We will also send you an email survey once per year to learn about any changes to your cancer care.",
  "consent_what_is_involved_in_study_3": "Because more rapid progress in understanding and treating cancer can occur when genetic and medical information is shared with other scientists, we will make it available to other researchers who apply for access to the database. Your information will be sent with only a code number attached. Your name or other directly identifiable information will not be shared.",
  "consent_study_duration_title": "How long will I be in this Research Study?",
  "consent_study_duration_body": "Your direct involvement will be limited to the time it takes to fill out the initial online survey, request your genetic data from the lab where it was generated, and complete the yearly survey about your ongoing care. Once provided, unless you later change your mind, your genetic and medical data will be stored indefinitely for future research use in our repository.",
  "consent_study_risks_title": "What are the risks or discomforts of the Research Study?",
  "consent_study_risks_1": "There are no physical risks in participating in this study, but there may be privacy and confidentiality risks. Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that your identity and/or data will never become known, however we estimate that the risk for such a confidentiality breach is low.",
  "consent_study_risks_2": "There is a risk that someone without permission could get access to the data we have stored about you, and could misuse this information. For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to obtain certain types of insurance. There are laws against this kind of misuse, but they may not give full protection. There may be other unforeseen privacy risks. We believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every effort to protect them. These efforts are described in the section below called “What about confidentiality?”",
  "consent_study_benefits_title": "What are the benefits of the Research Study?",
  "consent_study_benefits_body": "Taking part in this research study may or may not benefit you. We hope the information learned from this research study will increase our knowledge about the genetic basis of cancer.",

  "consent_stop_being_in_study_body": "You have the right to choose not to sign this form. If you decide not to sign this form, you cannot participate in this research study. <br> You can stop being in the research study at any time.

  "consent_study_costs_body": "There are no costs to participate in this research study. You will not be paid to be in this study. The information you share may lead to new products, research tools, or inventions that have financial value. There are no plans to pay you if your information is used for this purpose.",
  "consent_confidentiality_title": "What about confidentiality?",
  "consent_confidentiality_1": "Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will not be shared with anyone outside the Cancer Genome Collective team. Any data shared with researchers that are not part of this study team will be de-identified. This means that your data will be assigned a random ID when released to other researchers. Your de-identified data may also be shared in aggregate, which means combining your de-identified data with other subjects' de-identified data.",
  "consent_confidentiality_2": "We will take measures to protect the privacy and security of all your personal information by carefully limiting access to where your information is stored. As part of this study, the coded data will be encrypted and may be stored in the Cloud. The “Cloud” refers to computer servers in a data center that are accessible through the Internet. Again, your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. ",
