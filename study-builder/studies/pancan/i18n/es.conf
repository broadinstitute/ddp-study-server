  "s1_name": "1. Key Points",
  "s1_preamble": "“Count Me In” is a patient-driven movement that enables cancer patients to directly transform cancer research and discovery. Any individual who has ever been diagnosed with cancer has the opportunity to share information about their experience through completing surveys, sharing biological samples (saliva, blood and/or cancer samples, and in some cases, stool samples), and copies of their medical records with researchers in order to accelerate the pace of discovery. Because we are open to participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated, this study will allow many more cancer patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible.",
  "s1_purpose_title": "What is the purpose of this study?",
  "s1_purpose_body": "We want to better understand cancers so that we can develop more effective therapies. By partnering directly with patients, we are able to study many more aspects of different cancers than would otherwise be possible.",
  "s1_participation_title": "What will I have to do if I agree to participate in this study?",
  "s1_participation_body1": "After signing a consent form, you will be asked to complete surveys about your experience with cancer. Additional survey(s) may become available during the course of this research study that you can choose to complete.",
  "s1_participation_body2": "We will ask that you send a saliva sample to us in a pre-stamped package that we will provide.",
  "s1_participation_body3": "We will ask you to complete a medical release form so that we are able to request your medical records. If we do so, we will take care of obtaining copies of your records from the hospitals or centers where you receive your medical care. If needed, we may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign additional authorization forms or documents that certain hospitals or centers may require in order to share copies of your medical records with us.",
  "s1_participation_body4": "If you choose to share tissue specimens with us, we may also obtain small amounts of your stored cancer samples from hospitals or centers where you receive your care.",
  "s1_participation_body5": "If you choose to share blood with us, we may ask for a sample (or samples) of blood (1 tube, or 2 teaspoons per sample) to be drawn at your physician’s office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility – we will provide detailed instructions on how to do this.",
  "s1_voluntary_title": "Do I have to participate in this study?",
  "s1_voluntary_body": "No. Taking part in this study is voluntary. Even if you decide to participate now, you can always change your mind and leave the study at any time.",
  "s1_cost_title": "Will it cost me anything to participate in this study?",
  "s1_cost_body": "No.",
  "s1_benefits_title": "Will I benefit from participating?",
  "s1_benefits_body": "While taking part in this study may not improve your own health, the information we collect will aid in research efforts to provide better cancer treatment and prevention options to future patients. We will provide updates about key research discoveries made possible by your participation.",
  "s1_risks_title": "What are the risks of taking part in this research?",
  "s1_risks_body1": "If you choose to share blood, you may experience slight pain and swelling where the blood was drawn. These complications are rare and should resolve within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your doctor.",
  "s1_risks_body2": "There may be a risk that your information (which includes your genetic information and information from your medical records or surveys you’ve completed) could be seen by individuals who do not have permission to view it. However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to reduce this risk and protect the confidentiality of your information. There is also a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects you from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your risk.",
  "s1_sharing_title": "Who will use my samples and see my information?",
  "s1_sharing_body": "Your samples and health information will be available to study staff and researchers at Count Me In and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which are both not-for-profit research organizations. After removing your name and other readily identifiable information, we will share results obtained from your participation with the greater research community via established public scientific databases (for example, the National Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute data portals such as the Genomic Data Commons and dbGaP, and the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics). Some of these databases are publicly viewable by anyone with internet access, and some are restricted to qualified researchers.",
  "s1_withdraw_title": "Can I stop taking part in this research study?",
  "s1_withdraw_body": "Yes, you can withdraw from this research study at any time, although any information that has already been shared with researchers cannot be retrieved, and will not be deleted from our databases. Your information would be removed from future studies.",
  "s1_contact_title": "What if I have questions?",
  "s1_contact_body": "If you have any questions, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:info@joincountmein.org\" class=\"Link\">info@joincountmein.org</a> or call <a href=\"tel:XXX-XXX-XXXX\" class=\"Link\">XXX-XXX-XXXX</a> and ask to speak with a member of the study staff about this study.",
  "s2_name": "2. Full Form",
  "s2_intro_title": "Introduction",
  "s2_intro_body1": "You are being invited to participate in this research study because you have been diagnosed with cancer. This study will collect and analyze samples and health information of many patients with cancer, in order to help doctors and researchers better understand why cancers occur and develop ways to better treat and prevent them.",
  "s2_intro_body2": "Cancers occur when the molecules that control cell growth (such as genes or proteins) become changed or altered. Changes in genes are called “alterations” and can occur in cancer cells or normal tissues. Some alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified, which has led to the development of drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of cancer patients have not yet been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. A key goal of this research study is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the future development of new or improved ways to treat and prevent cancer.",
  "s2_intro_body3": "We may perform different tests or analyses to determine if cells in the samples provided through this study contain any alterations. As an example, we would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in cells using a technology called “sequencing.” Sequencing can be used to read the “letters” of DNA in samples and look for these alterations. Genes are composed of DNA “letters,” which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Using gene sequencing as a way to read DNA is one way to identify alterations that may contribute to the behavior of cancer. Some alterations or changes occur only in cancer cells. Other alterations may occur in normal cells as well, including in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both normal and cancer samples to look for alterations.",
  "s2_intro_body4": "Other than providing a saliva sample and, if you choose to, blood sample(s) (1 tube or 2 teaspoons per sample), participating in the study involves no new or additional tests or procedures. Cancer samples used for this study will come from stored samples obtained from previous clinical procedures. Study staff will not request samples unless they believe that the material remaining is sufficient for any future clinical needs.",
  "s2_intro_body5": "This form explains why this research study is being done, what is involved in participating, the possible risks and benefits of the study, alternatives to participation, and your rights as a participant. The decision to participate is yours. We encourage you to ask questions about the study now or in the future.",
  "s2_purpose_title": "Why is this research study being done?",
  "s2_purpose_body": "We want to understand cancer better so that we can develop more effective therapies. By partnering directly with patients, we will be able to study many more aspects of cancer than has previously been possible. In addition, because we are enrolling participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated, this study will allow many more patients to directly contribute to research than might otherwise be feasible.",
  "s2_voluntary_title": "What other options are there?",
  "s2_voluntary_body": "Taking part in this research study is voluntary – you may choose not to participate. Your decision not to participate will not affect your medical care in any way or result in any penalty or loss of benefits.",
  "s2_involvement_title": "What is involved in the research study?",
  "s2_involvement_body1": "After signing a consent form, you will be asked to complete surveys about your experience with cancer. Additional survey(s) may become available during the course of this research study that you can choose to complete.",
  "s2_involvement_body2": "We will also ask you to collect a sample of saliva at home--we will provide a kit and detailed instructions on how to do this.",
  "s2_involvement_body3": "As part of this research study, we may obtain copies of your medical records. We may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign any additional forms or documents that some hospitals or centers may require in order to share your medical records with us. You may also choose to send your medical records directly to us. We may link the information that comes from processing your samples with the information from your medical records.",
  "s2_involvement_body4": "If you choose to share blood samples with us, we may ask you to have a sample of blood (1 tube or 2 teaspoons) drawn at your physician’s office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility. We’ll ask you to send any blood and/or saliva sample(s) to us in pre-stamped packages that we will provide. We may ask you to provide blood at multiple different time points. We will contact you before sending the blood kit. If you do not want to participate in the blood draw at that time, please just inform a study staff member.",
  "s2_involvement_body5": "If you choose to share cancer samples with us, we may request a portion of your cancer sample through already stored biopsies or surgical specimens in hospitals or centers where you have received your medical care.",
  "s2_involvement_body6": "We may study the cells from your samples (such as your saliva, cancer samples, and/or blood samples), including the genes found in the cells. No additional procedures will be required. The results will be used to try to develop better ways to treat and prevent cancers.",
  "s2_involvement_body7": "To allow sharing of information with other researchers, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other organizations have developed central data (information) banks that analyze, collect, and share the information and results of certain types of genetic studies. Some (controlled-access) central data banks may store your genetic and medical information and provide the information to qualified researchers to use for further research. Other (open-access) data banks are publicly viewable by anyone with internet access. We will also store your genetic and medical information at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and share your information with other qualified researchers. Therefore, we are asking your permission to share your results with these special data banks and other researchers, and have your information used for future research studies, including studies that have not yet been designed, studies involving diseases other than cancer, and/or studies that may be for commercial purposes (such as the development or approval of new drugs). Your information will be sent to central banks and other researchers only with a code number attached. Your name and other information that could readily identify you will not be shared with central banks or other researchers. We will never sell your readily identifiable information to anyone under any circumstances.",
  "s2_involvement_body8": "In some cases, a researcher or study team member may contact you to find out if you would be interested in participating in a different or future research study based on information that may have been found in your samples or medical information.",
  "s2_timing_title": "How long will I be in this research study?",
  "s2_timing_body1": "We will keep your saliva, blood, and cancer samples and medical records indefinitely until this study is finished, unless you inform us that you no longer wish to participate. You may do this at any time. More information about how to stop being in the study can be found below in section K: “Can I stop being in the research study and what are my rights?”",
  "s2_timing_body2": "Once the study is finished, any left over saliva and blood samples and copies of your medical records will be destroyed. Any cancer samples that we have will be returned to the pathology department at the hospital or other place where you received treatment.",
  "s2_publishing_title": "What kind of information could be found in this study and will I be able to see it?",
  "s2_publishing_body": "While you will not receive information about your personal results obtained from studying your saliva, blood, or cancer samples, we will provide general results and major discoveries to all participants. We will do this by regularly updating participants through email newsletters, posts on social media, the Count Me In app, and/or the website that you used to enroll in this study. We will also publish important discoveries found through these studies in the scientific literature so that the entire research community can work together to better understand cancer. Your individual data will not be published in a way in which you could be readily identified. Abstracts, which are summaries of the published reports, will be available to you and the general public.",
  "s2_benefits_title": "What are the benefits of the research study?",
  "s2_benefits_body": "Taking part in this research study may not directly benefit you. By joining this study, you will help us and other researchers understand how to use gene tests to improve the care of patients with cancer in the future. We will provide study participants updates about key research discoveries made possible by your participation.",
  "s2_risks_title": "What are the risks or discomforts of the research study?",
  "s2_risks_body1": "If you choose to share blood, you may experience slight pain and swelling where the blood is drawn. These complications are rare and should get better within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your doctor.",
  "s2_risks_body2": "There is a risk that your information (which may include information from your survey responses, medical records, and/or sample testing and analysis) could be seen by people who do not have permission. However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to minimize this risk and protect the confidentiality of your information. We have tried to minimize this risk by only providing trained study staff members access to where your information is stored. There is a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects you from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your risk.",
  "s2_risks_body3": "There is a small but real risk that if your samples are used for this research study, they might not be available for clinical care in the future. However, we have attempted to minimize this risk in the following way: the pathologists where your specimens are kept will not release your specimen unless they believe that there is enough material remaining for your future medical care.",
  "s2_paid_title": "Will I be paid to take part in this research study?",
  "s2_paid_body": "You will not be paid to take part in this study.",
  "s2_cost_title": "What are the costs to take part in this research study?",
  "s2_cost_body": "There are no costs to you to take part in this study.",
  "s2_withdraw_title": "Can I stop being in the research study and what are my rights?",

Any individual who has ever been diagnosed with cancer has the opportunity to share information about their experience through completing surveys, sharing biological samples (saliva, blood and/or cancer samples, and in some cases, stool samples), and copies of their medical records with researchers in order to accelerate the pace of discovery. Because we are open to participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated, this study will allow many more cancer patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible.",
  "s1_purpose_body": "We want to better understand cancers so that we can develop more effective therapies. By partnering directly with patients and their families, we are able to study many more aspects of different cancers than would otherwise be possible.",
  "s1_participation_title": "What will I/my child have to do if we agree to participate in this study?",
  "s1_participation_body1": "After signing a consent form, you will be asked to complete surveys about your child’s experience with cancer. Additional survey(s) may become available during the course of this research study that you can choose to complete.",
  "s1_participation_body2": "We will ask that you send a sample of your child’s saliva to us in a pre-stamped package that we will provide.",
  "s1_participation_body3": "We will ask you to complete a medical release form so that we are able to request your child’s medical records. If we do so, we will take care of obtaining copies of your child’s records from the hospitals or centers where your child receives their medical care.

However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to reduce this risk and protect the confidentiality of your child’s information. There is also a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects your child from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against your child based on your child’s genetic information. However, this law does not protect your child against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If your child already has or has had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your child’s risk.",
  "s1_sharing_title": "Who will use my child’s samples and see my child’s information?",
  "s1_sharing_body": "Your child’s samples and health information will be available to study staff and researchers at Count Me In and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which are both not-for-profit research organizations.

This study will collect and analyze samples and health information of many patients with cancer, in order to help doctors and researchers better understand why cancers occur and develop ways to better treat and prevent them.",
  "s2_intro_body3": "We may perform different tests or analyses to determine if cells in the samples provided through this study contain any alterations. As an example, we would like to use your child’s DNA to look for alterations in cells using a technology called “sequencing.” Sequencing can be used to read the “letters” of DNA in samples and look for these alterations. Genes are composed of DNA “letters,” which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Using gene sequencing as a way to read DNA is one way to identify alterations that may contribute to the behavior of cancer. Some alterations or changes occur only in cancer cells. Other alterations may occur in normal cells as well, including in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both normal and cancer samples to look for alterations.",
  "s2_intro_body4": "Other than providing your child’s saliva sample and, if you choose to, your child’s blood sample(s) (1 tube or 2 teaspoons per sample), participating in the study involves no new or additional tests or procedures.

  "s2_involvement_body3": "As part of this research study, we may obtain copies of your child’s medical records. We may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign any additional forms or documents that some hospitals or centers may require in order to share your child’s medical records with us. You may also choose to send your child’s medical records directly to us. We may link the information that comes from processing your child’s samples with the information from your child’s medical records.",
  "s2_involvement_body4": "If you choose to share your child’s blood samples with us, we may ask you to have a sample of your child’s blood (1 tube or 2 teaspoons) drawn at your child’s physician’s office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility. We’ll ask you to send any blood and/or saliva sample(s) to us in pre-stamped packages that we will provide. We may ask you to provide blood at multiple different time points. We will contact you before sending the blood kit. If you do not want your child to participate in the blood draw at that time, please just inform a study staff member.",
  "s2_involvement_body5": "If you choose to share your child’s cancer samples with us, we may request a portion of your child’s cancer sample through already stored biopsies or surgical specimens in hospitals or centers where your child has received their medical care.",
  "s2_involvement_body6": "We may study the cells from your child’s samples (such as your child’s saliva, cancer samples, and/or blood samples), including the genes found in the cells. No additional procedures will be required. The results will be used to try to develop better ways to treat and prevent cancers.",
  "s2_involvement_body7": "To allow sharing of information with other researchers, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other organizations have developed central data (information) banks that analyze, collect, and share the information and results of certain types of genetic studies. Some (controlled-access) central data banks may store your child’s genetic and medical information and provide the information to qualified researchers to use for further research. Other (open-access) data banks are publicly viewable by anyone with internet access. We will also store your child’s genetic and medical information at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and share your child’s information with other qualified researchers. Therefore, we are asking your permission to share your child’s results with these special data banks and other researchers, and have your child’s information used for future research studies, including studies that have not yet been designed, studies involving diseases other than cancer, and/or studies that may be for commercial purposes (such as the development or approval of new drugs). Your child’s information will be sent to central banks and other researchers only with a code number attached. Your child’s name and other information that could readily identify your child will not be shared with central banks or other researchers. We will never sell your child’s readily identifiable information to anyone under any circumstances.",

  "s2_timing_body1": "We will keep your child’s saliva, blood, and cancer samples and medical records indefinitely until this study is finished, unless you inform us that you no longer wish to have your child participate. You may do this at any time. More information about how to stop being in the study can be found below in section K: “Can my child stop being in the research study and what are my child’s rights?”",
  "s2_timing_body2": "Once the study is finished, any left over saliva and blood samples and copies of your child’s medical records will be destroyed. Any cancer samples that we have will be returned to the pathology department at the hospital or other place where your child received treatment.",
  "s2_publishing_body": "While you will not receive information about your child’s results obtained from studying your child’s saliva, blood, or cancer samples, we will provide general results and major discoveries to all participants. We will do this by regularly updating participants through email newsletters, posts on social media, the Count Me In app, and/or the website that you used to enroll in this study. We will also publish important discoveries found through these studies in the scientific literature so that the entire research community can work together to better understand cancer. Your child’s individual data will not be published in a way in which your child could be readily identified. Abstracts, which are summaries of the published reports, will be available to you and the general public.",
  "s2_benefits_body": "Taking part in this research study may not directly benefit your child. By joining this study, you will help us and other researchers understand how to use gene tests to improve the care of patients with cancer in the future. We will provide study participants updates about key research discoveries made possible by your child’s participation.",
  "s2_risks_body1": "If you choose to share your child’s blood, they may experience slight pain and swelling where the blood is drawn. These complications are rare and should get better within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your child’s doctor.",
