Any individual who has ever been diagnosed with cancer has the opportunity to share information about their experience through completing surveys, sharing biological samples (saliva, blood and/or cancer samples, and in some cases, stool samples), and copies of their medical records with researchers in order to accelerate the pace of discovery. Because we are open to participants across the country regardless of where they are being treated, this study will allow many more cancer patients to contribute to research than has previously been possible.",
  "s1_purpose_title": "What is the purpose of this study?",
  "s1_purpose_body": "We want to better understand cancers so that we can develop more effective therapies. By partnering directly with patients, we are able to study many more aspects of different cancers than would otherwise be possible.",

  "s1_risks_body1": "If you choose to share blood, you may experience slight pain and swelling where the blood was drawn. These complications are rare and should resolve within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your doctor.",
  "s1_risks_body2": "There may be a risk that your information (which includes your genetic information and information from your medical records or surveys you’ve completed) could be seen by individuals who do not have permission to view it. However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to reduce this risk and protect the confidentiality of your information. There is also a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects you from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your risk.",

  "s1_sharing_body": "Your samples and health information will be available to study staff and researchers at Count Me In and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which are both not-for-profit research organizations. After removing your name and other readily identifiable information, we will share results obtained from your participation with the greater research community via established public scientific databases (for example, the National Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute data portals such as the Genomic Data Commons and dbGaP, and the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics). Some of these databases are publicly viewable by anyone with internet access, and some are restricted to qualified researchers.",

  "s2_intro_title": "Introduction",
  "s2_intro_body1": "You are being invited to participate in this research study because you have been diagnosed with cancer. This study will collect and analyze samples and health information of many patients with cancer, in order to help doctors and researchers better understand why cancers occur and develop ways to better treat and prevent them.",
  "s2_intro_body2": "Cancers occur when the molecules that control cell growth (such as genes or proteins) become changed or altered. Changes in genes are called “alterations” and can occur in cancer cells or normal tissues. Some alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified, which has led to the development of drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of cancer patients have not yet been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. A key goal of this research study is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the future development of new or improved ways to treat and prevent cancer.",
  "s2_intro_body3": "We may perform different tests or analyses to determine if cells in the samples provided through this study contain any alterations. As an example, we would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in cells using a technology called “sequencing.” Sequencing can be used to read the “letters” of DNA in samples and look for these alterations. Genes are composed of DNA “letters,” which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Using gene sequencing as a way to read DNA is one way to identify alterations that may contribute to the behavior of cancer. Some alterations or changes occur only in cancer cells. Other alterations may occur in normal cells as well, including in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both normal and cancer samples to look for alterations.",
  "s2_intro_body4": "Other than providing a saliva sample and, if you choose to, blood sample(s) (1 tube or 2 teaspoons per sample), participating in the study involves no new or additional tests or procedures. Cancer samples used for this study will come from stored samples obtained from previous clinical procedures. Study staff will not request samples unless they believe that the material remaining is sufficient for any future clinical needs.",

However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to minimize this risk and protect the confidentiality of your information. We have tried to minimize this risk by only providing trained study staff members access to where your information is stored. There is a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects you from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your risk.",
  "s2_risks_body3": "There is a small but real risk that if your samples are used for this research study, they might not be available for clinical care in the future.

Your child’s name and other information that could readily identify your child will not be shared with central banks or other researchers. We will never sell your child’s readily identifiable information to anyone under any circumstances.",
  "s2_involvement_body8": "In some cases, a researcher or study team member may contact you to find out if you would be interested in having your child participate in a different or future research study based on information that may have been found in your child’s samples or medical information.",
  "s2_timing_title": "How long will my child be in this research study?",
  "s2_timing_body1": "We will keep your child’s saliva, blood, and cancer samples and medical records indefinitely until this study is finished, unless you inform us that you no longer wish to have your child participate. You may do this at any time. More information about how to stop being in the study can be found below in section K: “Can my child stop being in the research study and what are my child’s rights?”",
  "s2_timing_body2": "Once the study is finished, any left over saliva and blood samples and copies of your child’s medical records will be destroyed. Any cancer samples that we have will be returned to the pathology department at the hospital or other place where your child received treatment.",
  "s2_publishing_body": "While you will not receive information about your child’s results obtained from studying your child’s saliva, blood, or cancer samples, we will provide general results and major discoveries to all participants. We will do this by regularly updating participants through email newsletters, posts on social media, the Count Me In app, and/or the website that you used to enroll in this study. We will also publish important discoveries found through these studies in the scientific literature so that the entire research community can work together to better understand cancer. Your child’s individual data will not be published in a way in which your child could be readily identified. Abstracts, which are summaries of the published reports, will be available to you and the general public.",
  "s2_benefits_body": "Taking part in this research study may not directly benefit your child. By joining this study, you will help us and other researchers understand how to use gene tests to improve the care of patients with cancer in the future. We will provide study participants updates about key research discoveries made possible by your child’s participation.",
  "s2_risks_body1": "If you choose to share your child’s blood, they may experience slight pain and swelling where the blood is drawn. These complications are rare and should get better within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your child’s doctor.",
  "s2_risks_body2": "There is a risk that your child’s information (which may include information from survey responses, medical records, and/or sample testing and analysis) could be seen by people who do not have permission. However, we have procedures and security measures in place designed to minimize this risk and protect the confidentiality of your child’s information. We have tried to minimize this risk by only providing trained study staff members access to where your child’s information is stored. There is a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects your child from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against your child based on your child’s genetic information. However, this law does not protect your child against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If your child already has or has had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your child’s risk.",
  "s2_risks_body3": "There is a small but real risk that if your child’s samples are used for this research study, they might not be available for clinical care in the future. However, we have attempted to minimize this risk in the following way: the pathologists where your child’s specimens are kept will not release the specimens unless they believe that there is enough material remaining for your child’s future medical care.",

  "s2_withdraw_body1": "Your child can stop being in the research study at any time. We will not be able to withdraw all the information that already has been used for research. If you tell us that you/your child want to stop being in the study, we will return any remaining cancer samples from where we obtained them, and destroy any remaining samples we have. We will not perform any additional tests on the samples. Additionally, we will not collect any additional medical records and we will destroy the copies of the medical records we already have. However, we will keep the results from the tests we did before your child stopped being in the study. We will also keep the information we learned from reviewing your child’s medical records before your child stopped being in the study. We will not be able to take back the information that already has been used or shared with other researchers, central data banks, or that has been used to carry out related activities such as oversight, or that is needed to ensure quality of the study.",
  "s2_withdraw_body2": "To withdraw your permission, you must do so in writing by contacting the researcher listed below in section N: “Whom do I contact if my child or I have questions about the research study?” If you/your child choose to not participate, or if your child is not eligible to participate, or if you withdraw your child from this research study, this will not affect your child’s present or future care and will not cause any penalty or loss of benefits to which your child is otherwise entitled.",
  "s2_injury_title": "What happens if my child is injured or sick because they took part in this research study?",
  "s2_injury_body": "There is little risk that your child will become injured or sick by taking part in this study. There are no plans for this project to pay you/your child or give you/your child other compensation for any injury. You and your child do not give up your legal rights by signing this form. If you/your child think you have been injured as a result of taking part in this research study, please tell the person in charge of this research study as soon as possible.

Information shared with the research team through email, or information accessible from a link in an email, is only protected by the security measures in place for you/your child’s email account. Information from your child’s medical records and genomic, histologic, and/or molecular tests will be protected in a HIPAA compliant database. HIPAA is a federal law that established national standards to protect sensitive health information from being disclosed without a patient's consent or knowledge.",
  "s2_confidentiality_body2": "Your child’s name and other information that could be used to readily identify them will be removed from their samples, and replaced by a randomized code. If we send their samples to other researchers for testing, the samples will be identified using only this code.",
  "s2_confidentiality_body3": "We will store all of your child’s identifiable information related to the study (including your child’s medical records) in locked file cabinets and in password-protected computer files or secure databases at the Broad Institute and we will limit access to such files. We may share your child’s identifiable information or coded information, as necessary, with regulatory or oversight authorities (such as the federal Office for Human Research Protections), ethics committees reviewing the conduct of the study, or as otherwise required by law. When we send information to central data banks or other researchers, it will not contain your child’s name or other information that could be used to readily identify your child.",
