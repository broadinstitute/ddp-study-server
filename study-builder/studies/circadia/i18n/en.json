  "consent_research_reason_p1": "This research study is investigating the role of genetics in circadian rhythms.  One way to measure our circadian rhythms is to look at levels of the hormone melatonin.  Our bodies produce melatonin at night.  The time of day when melatonin production begins is an indicator of the our circadian rhythm (called melatonin onset).  To determine when melatonin production begins, we measure melatonin onset in a series of saliva samples collected from people before, during, and after bedtime in dim light conditions.  We are doing this research to test at-home, self-directed instructions and collections of dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) samples.",
