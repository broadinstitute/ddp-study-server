This study will help doctors and researchers better understand why angiosarcoma occurs and develop ways to better treat and prevent it.<br> Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered. Changes in the genes of tumor cells and normal tissues are called \"alterations.\" Several alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development of new drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the development of additional therapies and cures.<br> Genes are composed of DNA \"letters,\" which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. We would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in cancer cell genes using a technology called \"sequencing.\" <br> Gene sequencing is a way of reading the DNA to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes.<br> You are being asked to participate in the study because you have angiosarcoma. Other than providing samples of saliva and, if you elect to, blood (1 tube or 2 teaspoons), participating in the study involves no additional tests or procedures.<br> This form explains why this research study is being done, what is involved in participating, the possible risks and benefits of the study, alternatives to participation, and your rights as a participant. The decision to participate is yours. We encourage you to ask questions about the study now or in the future.</p>"
