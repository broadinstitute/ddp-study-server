  <li class="PageContent-text topMarginMedium">
  You can perform (or collaborate with others to perform) gene tests on the blood sample that I will send you
  and store the sample until this research study is complete.

  You can share the results of the gene tests and my medical information with established public databases
  (e.g., the NIH, cBioPortal, Tumor Portal, The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)/Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD))
  and with other qualified researchers in a manner that does not include my name, social security number, or any other
  information that could be used to readily identify me, to be used by other qualified researchers to perform future
  research studies, including studies that have not yet been designed, studies for diseases other than cancer, and
