  "ds_patient_limit_irb_exp": "If you choose this limit, it means that only researchers that have had their studies reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may access the patient’s data for their research. An IRB is a type of committee that reviews research studies and methods to make sure they are not harmful to people. Most of the people who are on an IRB have professional expertise to be able to review the research. The IRB has scientists and nonscientists as part of the committee. When you make this choice, a researcher must present written proof of the IRB’s approval, or proof of exemption, of their study before they can access the patient’s data for their research.",
