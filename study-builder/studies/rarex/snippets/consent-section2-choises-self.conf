              <p>You will have to choose one of the following two types of research</p>
              <ol type="1"><li><b>General Research</b> This is the broadest type of research. When you choose General Research
              researchers may use your data for:
              <ol type="a"><li><b>Health/Medical/Biomedical Research</b>
              <p>Researchers can access and use your data to learn more about a health condition,
              its causes, symptoms, progression and treatments. This type of research could
              include research on any health condition, even if it is not a rare disease.</p>
              <p><i>and</i></p></li>
              <li><b>Other kinds</b> of studies that are not related to health such as
              <ul><li>Research on age, race, and ethnicity</li>
              <li>Research studying traits such as how long people live or how easily they may get sick</li>
              <li>Research about genetic traits of different populations</li>
              <li>Studies to develop survey questions to improve research</li></ul>
              <p><b><i>or</i></b></p></li></ol>
              <li><b>Health/Medical/Biomedical Research</b> This type of research is narrower than type 1, General
              Research.</li></ol>
              <p>If you choose just Health/Medical/Biomedical Research, your data may be used for fewer types of
              research studies than if you choose General Research.</p>
              <p>If you choose just Health/Medical/Biomedical Research, your data may <i>only</i> be used to learn more
              about a health condition, its cause, symptoms, progression, and treatments. (Research described
              in section 1.a above)</p>
              <p>Your data will <b><i>not</i></b> be used for other kinds of studies not related to health described in section 1.b
              above.</p>
              <p><b>Other Limits on Sharing for Research</b></p>
              <p>You will also be able to choose to further <b><i>limit or restrict</i></b> how your data is used for research.
              You donâ€™t have to put any further limits on how your data is used, but if you would like to, you
              can choose restrictions such as:</p>
              <ol type="A"><li>Not allowing your data to be used for commercial/for-profit research purposes</li>
              <li>Not allowing your data to be used for research projects unless an Institutional Review
              Board (IRB) has approved them.
              <p>An Institutional Review Board, is a type of committee that reviews research studies
              and methods to make sure they are not harmful to people. Most of the people who are on
              an IRB have professional expertise to be able to review the research. The IRB has scientists
              and nonscientists as part of the committee.</p></li></ol>
              <p>Whether you say yes or no to these choices, you can still take part in this Program.</p>
