                <p><u>Patient Organizations</u><br/>
                RARE-X understands the importance of patient organization support in the rare
                disease communities. You may choose to share identifiable information with
                patient organizations associated with the patient's disease so that the
                organization may contact and help you.
                <ul><li>You can choose to share your contact information (your name and email
                address) with any patient organizations that are affiliated with the patient's
                rare disease. The patient organization may use your contact information for
                newsletters or other purposes.</li>
                <li>You can choose to share your contact information and identifiable patient
                health information with certain patient organizations that are deemed to be
                qualified by RARE-X. To be considered "qualified" by RARE-X an organization
                must 1) be associated with your rare disease and 2) have the ability to
                handle, store and analyze identified health data. These patient
                organizations would help you make sure that your survey answers are
                accurate and complete.</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p> You may also choose to share identifiable information with qualified patient
                organizations for them to use in research which is publicly published and for
                internal analysis.</p>
                <p>Your choices are voluntary. If you decide to share your information with a patient
                organization, you may choose for one or more of the purposes listed above.<br/>
                These patient organizations must sign an agreement with RARE-X saying they will
                only use this identifiable information for the purposes you have chosen.<br/>
                You will be able to make these choices on a separate form. You can say no to any of
                these choices. You can say yes to one or more of these choices. Whether you say
                yes or no to these choices, you can still take part in this Program.</p>

                <p><u>Researchers</u><br/>
                Once you have agreed to participate in this study, you will be able to choose who
                may access your <b>de-identified information for research</b>. You can change your
                choices at any time. <b><i>You will be able to choose one or more of these categories.</i></b><br/>
                Here is a list of the choices you will be offered:
                <ol><li><b>Anyone wanting to study data associated with rare disease</b>. This category
                includes <b>all</b> the researchers listed below. It also includes citizen scientists.
                Citizen scientists are people who research science in their spare time.</li>
                <li><b>All researchers with documented proof of professional standing in the
                research community</b>. This category does not include citizen scientists. Saying
                yes to this category would include researchers who study conditions or
                symptoms that frequently occur in the general population</li>
                <li><b>Researchers who are known to conduct research on the rare disease that
                you are afflicted with</b>. This group of researchers is more limited than those in
                number 2. This category includes only researchers who specialize in your rare
                disease.</li>
                <li><b>Only researchers that have had their studies reviewed by an Institutional
                Review Board (IRB) based on ethical and scientific principles</b>. Researchers in
                this category must present proof of the IRB's approval of their study before
                they can access your information for their study.</li>
                <li><b>Data repositories operated by other organizations</b> may have access to your
                de-identified information. Allowing this type of sharing helps reduce
                duplication of efforts. It also would make your de-identified information
                available to a greater number of researchers.</li>
                <li><b>Commercial companies</b>, such as drug companies and biotechnology for
                research.</li>
                </ol>
                <u>Business and legal purposes</u><br/>
                We may share your health information without your consent with:
                <ul><li>A limited number of RARE-X staff and contractors who need the
                information to perform their jobs; or</li>
                <li>As necessary, with federal regulatory or oversight authorities; or</li>
                <li>Our IRB so that they can make sure we are complying with your consent
                and the ways that we have said we would conduct this study; or</li>
                <li>Officials if otherwise required by law (such as if we find or suspect child
                abuse).</li></ul>"""
