              <p>You will have to choose <b><i>one</i></b> of the following two types of research:</p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li><b>General Research</b> This is the broadest type of research. When you choose General Research researchers may use the participant’s data for:
                  <ol type="a"><li><b>Health/Medical/Biomedical Research</b>
                  <p>Researchers can access and use the participant’s data to learn more about a
                  health condition, its causes, symptoms, progression and treatments. This type of
                  research could include research on any health condition, even if it is not a rare
                  disease.</p>
                  <p><i>and</i></p></li>
                  <li><b>Other kinds</b> of studies that are not related to health such as
                    <ul><li>Research on age, race, and ethnicity</li>
                    <li>Research studying traits such as how long people live or how easily they may get sick</li>
                    <li>Research about genetic traits of different populations</li>
                    <li>Studies to develop survey questions to improve research</li></ul>
                  </li></ol>
                <p><b><i>or</i></b></p></li>
                <li><b>Health/Medical/Biomedical Research</b> This type of research is narrower than type 1, General Research.
                  <p>If you choose just Health/Medical/Biomedical Research, the participant’s data may be used for
                  fewer types of research studies than if you choose General Research.</p>
                  <p>If you choose just Health/Medical/Biomedical Research, the participant’s data may <i>only</i> be used
                  to learn more about a health condition, its cause, symptoms, progression, and treatments.
                  (Research described in section 1.a above)</p>
                  <p>The participant’s data will <b><i>not</i></b> be used for other kinds of studies not related to health described
                  in section 1.b above.</p></li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>Other Limits on Sharing for Research</b></p>
              <p>You will also be able to choose to further <b><i>limit or restrict</i></b> how the participant’s data is used for
              research. You don’t have to put any further limits on how the participant’s data is used, but if
              you would like to, you can choose restrictions such as:</p>
                <ol type="A"><li>Not allowing the participant’s data to be used for commercial/for-profit research purposes</li>
                <li> Not allowing the participant’s data to be used for research studies unless an Institutional
                Review Board (IRB) has reviewed them.</li></ol>
              <p>An Institutional Review Board is a type of committee that reviews research studies and
              methods to help protect the rights and welfare of study participants. Most of the people who
              are on an IRB have professional expertise to be able to review the research. The IRB has
              scientists and nonscientists as part of the committee.</p>
              <p>Whether you say yes or no to these choices, the participant can still take part in this program.</p>
