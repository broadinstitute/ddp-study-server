              In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure, there is a Federal law, known as the Genetic
              Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects your child from genetic discrimination. GINA
              generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to
              discriminate against your child based on your child's genetic information. However, this law does not protect your child
              against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term
              care insurance. If your child already has or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results
