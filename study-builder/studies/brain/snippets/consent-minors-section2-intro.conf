              Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered.
              Changes in the genes of tumor cells and normal tissues are called "alterations." Several alterations
              that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development
              of new drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from
              patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to
              be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been
