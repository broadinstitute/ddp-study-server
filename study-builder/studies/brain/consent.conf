This study will help doctors and researchers better understand why brain cancer occurs and develop ways to better treat and prevent it.<br> Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered. Changes in the genes of tumor cells and normal tissues are called \"alterations.\" Several alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development of new drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the development of additional therapies and cures.<br> Genes are composed of DNA \"letters,\" which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. We would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in cancer cell genes using a technology called \"sequencing.\" <br> Gene sequencing is a way of reading the DNA to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes.<br> You are being asked to participate in the study because you have brain cancer. Other than providing samples of saliva and, if you elect to, blood sample(s) (1 tube or 2 teaspoons per sample), participating in the study involves no additional tests or procedures.<br> This form explains why this research study is being done, what is involved in participating, the possible risks and benefits of the study, alternatives to participation, and your rights as a participant. The decision to participate is yours. We encourage you to ask questions about the study now or in the future.</p>"

You may experience slight pain and swelling at the site of the blood draw. These complications are rare and should resolve within a few days. If they do not, you should contact your doctor.<br> There is a small risk that by participating in this study, the gene test results, including the identification of genetic changes in you or your cancer, could be seen by unauthorized individuals. We have tried to minimize this risk by carefully limiting access to the computers that would house your information to the staff of this research study.<br> In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure, there is a Federal law, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which protects you from genetic discrimination. GINA generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. If you already have or have had cancer, any unauthorized disclosure of genetic results is unlikely to change an insurer’s view of your risk.<br> There is a small but real risk that if your samples are used for this research study, they might not be available for clinical care in the future. However, we have attempted to minimize this risk in the following way: the pathologists in the department of pathology where your specimens are kept will not release your specimen unless they believe that the material remaining after the research test is performed is sufficient for any future clinical needs.</p>"
