                        Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered.
                          Changes in the genes of tumor cells and normal tissues are called "alterations." Several alterations that occur in
                          certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development of new drugs that
                          specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied,
                          which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more
                          alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the
                          development of additional therapies and cures.
