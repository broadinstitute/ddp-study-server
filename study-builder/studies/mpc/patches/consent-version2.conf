      Participation requires little effort. With your permission, we may ask that you send a saliva sample to us in a pre-stamped package that we will provide. We may also ask for your medical records. If so, we will take care of obtaining copies of your medical records from the hospitals or centers where you receive your medical care. If needed, we may contact you to ask if you would be willing to sign an additional release form for your medical records to be shared with us. If you elect to share tissue with us, we may also obtain small amounts of your stored tumor tissues from hospitals or centers where you receive your care. If you elect to share blood with us, we may ask you to have a sample of blood (1 tube or 2 teaspoons) drawn at your physician’s office, local clinic, or nearby lab facility – we will provide detailed instructions on how to do this.

                          You are being invited to participate in a research study that will collect and analyze samples and health
                          information of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, also called Stage IV or advanced prostate cancer. This study
                          will help doctors and researchers better understand why metastatic prostate cancer occurs and develop ways to better
                          treat and prevent it.

                          Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered.
                          Changes in the genes of tumor cells and normal tissues are called "alterations." Several alterations that occur in
                          certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development of new drugs that
                          specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied,
                          which means there is a tremendous amount of information still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more
                          alterations, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this could lead to the
                          development of additional therapies and cures.

                          Genes are composed of DNA "letters," which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how
                          to grow and work. We would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in cancer cell genes using a technology
                          called "sequencing.

                        Gene sequencing is a way of reading the DNA to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the
                          behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the
                          genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes.
