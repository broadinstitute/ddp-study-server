              We (the sponsors) want to better understand genetic and other biological and lifestyle-related factors affecting people
              with A-T so that we can work toward developing more effective therapies and diagnostics. By partnering directly with people
              who have A-T, and enabling an ongoing dialogue with researchers, we will be able to study many more cases worldwide and
              create a comprehensive and evolving resource for A-T genetics and health characteristics. This is a critical step toward
              developing potential therapies and improving care."""
