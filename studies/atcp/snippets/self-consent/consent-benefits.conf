              Participating in this study is unlikely to directly or immediately improve your own health. However, the information we

              We will provide updates on our website about key research discoveries made possible by your participation. We will not be
              able to provide you with any specific information about your own genetic data. If, at some point in the future, we believe
              that analysis of your genetic results may impact or change your diagnosis of A-T, we will contact your doctor, if you
              have agreed to this beforehand."""
