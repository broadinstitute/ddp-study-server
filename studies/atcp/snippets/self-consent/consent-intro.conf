                  research and treatment of the disease by sharing their genetic data and related health information with researchers
                  around the world. If families also agree to allow researchers to contact them with follow-up research questions, the
                  platform will enable the A-T community to have a continuous dialogue with researchers and potentially accelerate
                  progress in A-T research.
                  The ultimate goal of this effort is to create an environment in which the A-T community and their families contribute
                  their clinical and genetic data and govern the sharing of these data with researchers to better understand the disease."""
